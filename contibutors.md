# 🏅 Badge System (Coming Soon!)
We’re designing a glowing badge system to celebrate contributions like:
- 💡 **Idea Spark** — for sharing new concepts
- 🔧 **Prototype Builder** — for coding experiments
- 🖌️ **Design Wizard** — for visual flair
- 📚 **Documentarian** — for clear guides
- 🌐 **Community Connector** — for collaboration

Badges will be SVG icons stored in `/badges/` and contributors can embed them in their profile cards.
**Earned Badges:**
<div class="contributor-badges">

- 🔧 **Prototype Builder**  
  Given to contributors who code, experiment, or build working prototypes that push ideas forward.

- 🖌️ **Design Wizard**  
  Earned by those who add visual flair, branding, or UI/UX magic to the project.

- 📚 **Documentarian**  
  Recognizes contributors who write clear guides, onboarding docs, or tutorials that help others join in.

- 🌐 **Community Connector**  
  Celebrates those who collaborate, connect contributors, or expand the project’s reach.
